Re:	Annual TB Test<br />
<br />
<p>Your TB Test has expired and is over the one-year validity period.
Please make every effort to get the test completed and have a copy of the results faxed to our office.
Your last TB test was <strong><?php echo $expiration ?></strong>.
Please make an effort to have your test done before the expiration date.</p>
<br />

<br />
Thank you.<br />
